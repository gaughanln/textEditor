# textEditor ðŸ—’

## Description
Nothing worse than when the internet goes down. You can't access the google calendar, check your email, and so much more. Worry not, I've created a note taker that can be used while online or offline so you don't have to worry about what happens when the internet goes out!

## Criteria:
Must be able to do the following:

  * Run npm start concurrently from the client + server
  * Bundle files using webpack that includes html, service worker, and manifest.json
  * Text remains constant in the IndexedDB
  * When install button is clicked, the application is downloaded to the desktop

Must use the following:
  * idb
  * Babel
  * Service worker using workbox
  * Deploy to Heroku
